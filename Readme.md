# GardenerHelper
An android app designed for gardeners to track their plant watering times.

This is my version of ThinMatrix's app which he showed on one video [his channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix/about]

The app allows the user to add new plants- with their picture, name and watering cycle length. The user can also edit existing plants as needed. The functionality of the app is explained in the help menu (tap on the questionmark).
