# GardenerHelper
An android app that allows gardeners to track their plant watering times.

This is my version of ThinMatrix's app which he showed on one video [his channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix/about]

The app has a help menu (tap on the questionmark) which explains everything that is important.
